### **Component Architecture**
```
src/views/Cryptography.vue           # Main view with tab management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/components/cryptography/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HashTool.vue                 # Hash generation component
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ VerifyTool.vue              # File verification component
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EncryptDecryptTool.vue      # Encryption/decryption component
```

### **Key Features Implemented**
- **File Processing**: Secure FileReader API usage with ArrayBuffer handling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management and user feedback
- **Security**: Client-side processing, no server data transmission
- **Performance**: Efficient memory usage and progress indicators
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across all components

---

## üêõ **Issues Resolved**

### **Linter Errors Fixed**
- **Issue**: `node-forge` import errors for unsupported MD2/MD4 algorithms
