# Migration Summary: Vue 2 to Vue 3 + ESM

## Overview

This branch contains the migration plan and example files for converting Sparkplate from Vue 2 + CommonJS to Vue 3 + ESM. The work was organized into a structured plan with example implementations to guide the development team through the migration process.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Migration Plan Creation**
   - Created a detailed migration plan (`docs/processes/migrationPlan.md`) outlining the step-by-step process for migrating from Vue 2 to Vue 3 and CommonJS to ESM
   - Organized the migration into logical phases to ensure a smooth transition
   - Provided testing strategies and error handling procedures

2. **Example Implementations**
   - Created working example files in `docs/examples` with the `.ex` suffix to avoid linting issues
   - Demonstrated how key components of the application should be migrated
   - Provided side-by-side comparisons of Vue 2 and Vue 3 code where appropriate

## Examples Directory

The `docs/examples` directory contains reference implementations demonstrating the target architecture for various components of the application. Each file has a `.ex` suffix to prevent linting tools from flagging them, as they are meant for reference and not to be used directly in the project.

### Example Files

1. **`component.vue.ex`**
   - Demonstrates the migration from Vue 2 Options API to Vue 3 Composition API
   - Includes both the original Options API implementation (commented out) and the new Composition API implementation
   - Shows proper usage of ref, computed, lifecycle hooks, and other Vue 3 features

2. **`main.js.ex`**
   - Shows how to initialize a Vue 3 application using `createApp()` instead of `new Vue()`
   - Demonstrates proper plugin registration with Vue 3
   - Shows how to set up global properties in Vue 3

3. **`router.js.ex`**
   - Demonstrates Vue Router 4 configuration for Vue 3
   - Shows how to use the new router initialization pattern
   - Includes examples of route definitions and navigation guards

4. **`settings.store.js.ex`**
   - Shows how to migrate Vuex stores to Pinia
   - Demonstrates the use of the Composition API with Pinia
   - Includes examples of state, getters, and actions

5. **`vite.config.js.ex`**
   - Provides a Vite configuration optimized for Vue 3 and ESM
   - Demonstrates proper alias configuration
   - Includes build options for both development and production

6. **`electron-builder-config.js.ex`**
   - Shows how to configure Electron Builder for ESM
   - Demonstrates proper main process configuration
   - Includes platform-specific build options

7. **`package.json.ex`**
   - Shows the required dependencies for Vue 3 and ESM
   - Includes updated scripts for the build process
   - Demonstrates the use of `"type": "module"` for ESM support

## Migration Strategy

The migration is planned in three phases:

1. **Phase 1: Initial ESM Migration (Render Process Only)**
   - Update render process files to use ESM syntax
   - Keep Vue 2 compatibility during this phase
   - Update the build configuration for ESM support

2. **Phase 2: Vue 3 Migration**
   - Upgrade Vue and related dependencies
   - Migrate components from Options API to Composition API
   - Convert Vuex stores to Pinia
   - Update Vue Router to version 4

3. **Phase 3: Electron Main Process ESM Migration**
   - Convert Electron main process code to ESM
   - Update IPC communication patterns
   - Update build configuration for full ESM support

## Next Steps

To proceed with the migration:

1. Begin with Phase 1 by implementing ESM syntax in the render process
2. Test thoroughly with both development and production builds
3. Progress to Vue 3 migration once ESM syntax is stable
4. Complete the migration with Electron main process changes
5. Perform comprehensive testing of the entire application

The examples provided in `docs/examples` should serve as a reference for how to implement each step of the migration process.
