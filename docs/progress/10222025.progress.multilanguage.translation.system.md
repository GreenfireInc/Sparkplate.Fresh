- Type-safe language code management

### **Reactive System**
- Vue composables for reactive language switching
- Automatic UI updates when language changes
- Real-time synchronization between components
- Efficient re-rendering with minimal performance impact

### **Persistence & State Management**

## Integration Architecture

### **Unified Translation System**
```typescript
// Single interface for all translations
const { 
  t,           // i18n translations (app content)
  tMenu,       // menu translations only
  tUniversal,  // universal (menu first, then i18n)
  changeLanguage,
  languages,
  currentLanguageInfo
} = useUnifiedTranslations()
```

### **Language Switching Flow**
1. User selects language in UI component
2. `changeLanguage()` function called
3. App content updates immediately
4. IPC message sent to main process
5. Electron menu updates dynamically
6. Language preference saved to localStorage
7. All components using system update automatically
