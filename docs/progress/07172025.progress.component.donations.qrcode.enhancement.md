# Progress Report: Donations QR Code Hover Enhancement

**Date:** July 17, 2025  
**Component:** `src/components/modals/about/Donations.vue`  
**Type:** User Experience Enhancement  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  

## Overview

Enhanced the QR code hover functionality in the Donations modal to provide a better user experience with centered magnification and improved visual feedback for cryptocurrency donation addresses.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. QR Code Hover Behavior Enhancement

**Previous State:**
- QR codes had basic hover effects with in-place scaling
- Different behavior for different cryptocurrencies
- Glitching and flickering issues
- Poor readability when magnified

**New Implementation:**
- Unified overlay system for all cryptocurrency QR codes
- Centered magnification in modal overlay
- Smooth transitions without glitching
- High-quality QR code rendering

### 2. Technical Improvements

#### Overlay System
```vue
<!-- Hover overlay for centered QR codes -->
<div 
  v-if="hoveredQR && shouldCenterMagnify(hoveredQR)"
  class="qr-overlay"
  @mouseenter="clearHoverTimeout"
  @mouseleave="scheduleHoverTimeout"
>
  <div class="magnified-qr-container">
    <button @click="hoveredQR = null" class="close-btn">&times;</button>
    <!-- QR Code and Logo -->
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Timeout-based Hover Management
- Implemented 100ms delay before hiding overlay
- Prevents rapid flickering during mouse movement
- Smooth transitions between hover states

#### Enhanced QR Generation
- Increased resolution from 100px to 200px
- Higher error correction level ('H')
- Better margin and color contrast
- Crisp rendering with `image-rendering` properties

### 3. User Interface Improvements

#### Close Button Integration
- Added consistent close button styling matching `About.vue`
- Multiple ways to dismiss overlay:
  - Click close button (×)
  - Move mouse away from area
  - Click outside overlay

#### Visual Design
- Semi-transparent dark overlay background
- White container with rounded corners and shadow
- Proper z-index layering
- Responsive design considerations

## Cryptocurrencies Supported

All 9 cryptocurrencies now use the unified overlay system:
- Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
- Bitcoin (BTC) 
- Litecoin (LTC)
- Ethereum (ETH)
- Dogecoin (DOGE)
- Tezos (XTZ)
- Terra Classic (LUNC)
- Solana (SOL)
- Binance Coin (BNB)

## Code Structure

### New Functions Added
- `handleMouseEnter(address)` - Manages hover state entry
- `handleMouseLeave()` - Manages hover state exit with timeout
- `clearHoverTimeout()` - Cancels pending hide timeout
- `scheduleHoverTimeout()` - Sets up delayed hide with 100ms timeout
- `shouldCenterMagnify(address)` - Determines if QR should use overlay (all currencies)

### CSS Enhancements
- `.qr-overlay` - Full-screen overlay positioning
- `.magnified-qr-container` - Centered QR container styling
- `.magnified-qr-code` - High-quality QR rendering (250px)
- `.close-btn` - Consistent close button styling
- Improved transitions and hover effects

## Testing Results

### Before Enhancement
- ❌ QR codes glitched during hover
- ❌ Inconsistent behavior between cryptocurrencies
- ❌ Poor readability when magnified
- ❌ No clear way to dismiss magnified view

### After Enhancement
- ✅ Smooth, glitch-free hover experience
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all cryptocurrencies
- ✅ High-quality, readable QR codes
- ✅ Multiple intuitive dismissal methods
- ✅ Professional, polished user interface

## Performance Impact

- **Positive:** Pre-generation of QR codes improves hover response time
- **Minimal:** Timeout management adds negligible overhead
- **Improved:** Higher quality QR codes enhance scanning success rate

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with CSS backdrop-filter support
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Mobile-responsive design maintained

## Future Considerations

1. **Accessibility:** Could add keyboard navigation support
2. **Analytics:** Track QR code engagement metrics
3. **Customization:** Allow users to adjust magnification level
4. **Mobile:** Consider touch-optimized interactions

## Files Modified

- `src/components/modals/about/Donations.vue` - Main implementation
- Enhanced template structure for overlay system
- Improved script logic for hover management
- Updated SCSS styling for better visual presentation

## Conclusion

Successfully transformed a problematic QR code hover system into a polished, professional user experience. The enhancement provides consistent behavior, eliminates technical issues, and significantly improves usability for cryptocurrency donations.

**Impact:** Major improvement to user experience and donation accessibility
**Risk Level:** Low - Non-breaking changes with fallback behavior
**Maintainability:** High - Clean, well-structured code with clear separation of concerns
