Component: NetworkStatus  

## Overview

The NetworkStatus component has been successfully moved from the settings directory to the global directory and enhanced with additional functionality. This component now provides a more versatile and reusable way to display network connection status, IP address, and country information throughout the application.

## Changes Made

1. **Component Relocation**
   - Moved `NetworkStatus.vue` from `src/components/settings/` to `src/components/global/`
   - Updated all import references in the application to point to the new location

2. **Enhanced Functionality**
   - Added IP address display with automatic detection
   - Implemented country detection with flag display
   - Created custom country flag implementation using CSS and data URIs
   - Added support for both horizontal and vertical layouts
   - Made status text clickable to refresh connection information
   - Added option to hide status text when only IP/country information is needed

3. **Improved UI**
   - Simplified component structure by removing unnecessary container elements
   - Made the component more adaptable to different contexts by inheriting font sizes
   - Increased flag size for better visibility
   - Added hover effects for interactive elements

4. **Technical Improvements**
   - Added TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for country detection
   - Added proper error handling for network requests
   - Created Vue 3 compatible implementation without external dependencies

## Integration Points

The component has been integrated into:

- Settings view (`src/views/Settings.vue`)
- About modal (`src/components/modals/about/Main.vue`)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```vue
<NetworkStatus />
```

### Vertical Layout with Hidden Status
```vue
<NetworkStatus :vertical="true" :hideStatus="true" />
```

### In List Context
```vue
<ul>
  <li><b>Hostname:</b> example.com</li>
  <NetworkStatus :vertical="true" :hideStatus="true" />
  <li><b>OS:</b> Linux</li>
</ul>
```

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding more country flags to the collection
2. Explore options for caching IP and country information
3. Add more detailed network information (speed, latency, etc.)
4. Implement unit tests for the component

## Conclusion

The NetworkStatus component is now a more versatile and reusable part of the application. It provides valuable network information to users while maintaining a clean and consistent interface. The component is now ready for use throughout the application wherever network status information is needed.
