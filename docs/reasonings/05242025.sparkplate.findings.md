   - Add E2E testing with Cypress
   - Establish CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

Sparkplate Fresh has a solid foundation with Vue 3, Vite, and Electron. The project has clear documentation of intended features and architecture, but the actual implementation is in early stages. Following the comprehensive plan outlined in the rules documentation will result in a robust boilerplate for cryptocurrency applications.
