# About Modal Layout Improvements

**Date**: July 18, 2025  
**Component**: `src/components/modals/about/Main.vue`  
**Author**: Corey  

## Problem Statement

The About modal in Sparkplate needed layout improvements to better showcase the application logo while maintaining system information visibility. The original layout had the logo on the left side at a smaller size, which didn't give it enough prominence.

## Solution Approach

We restructured the About modal layout to:

1. Move the Sparkplate logo to the right side of the modal
2. Increase the logo size for better visibility and impact
3. Position the system information on the left side
4. Maintain a clean two-column layout for better visual balance

## Implementation Details

### Layout Structure Changes

The implementation involved modifying the component's template structure from a stacked layout to a side-by-side layout with the following changes:

```vue
<div class="row">
  <!-- Info section on the left -->
  <div class="col-6 info-column">
    <!-- System information content -->
  </div>
  
  <!-- Logo section on the right -->
  <div class="col-6">
    <div class="center-content">
      <a href="https://www.greenfire.io" target="_blank">
        <img 
          src="/assets/icons/greenfire/sparkplate.png" 
          alt="sparkplate-logo" 
          style="width: 250px; height: auto;" 
        />
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Styling Approach

Several approaches were tested to properly size the logo:

1. Initially tried CSS class-based styling with Tailwind directives:
   ```css
   .logo {
     @apply max-w-[32rem] w-full h-auto;
   }
   ```

2. Found that container constraints were limiting the logo's size, so we moved to:
   - A full-width approach initially
   - Then a two-column layout with direct inline styling
   - Used explicit width in pixels to avoid any CSS inheritance issues

3. Final solution used inline styling directly on the image element:
   ```html
   <img 
     src="/assets/icons/greenfire/sparkplate.png" 
     alt="sparkplate-logo" 
     style="width: 250px; height: auto;" 
   />
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Visual Hierarchy**: The logo now has more prominence while maintaining access to system information
2. **Better Space Utilization**: The two-column layout makes better use of the available modal space
3. **Enhanced Branding**: The larger logo reinforces the application's brand identity
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All system information remains accessible and clearly visible

## Considerations

- The logo size (250px) was chosen to balance visibility with the available space in the modal
- Inline styling was used to ensure consistent rendering across different environments
- The layout maintains responsiveness while prioritizing the desktop viewing experience

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements could include:

1. Adding responsive breakpoints for smaller screen sizes
2. Implementing a subtle animation when the modal opens
3. Adding hover effects to the logo link
4. Exploring dark mode-specific styling for the modal
