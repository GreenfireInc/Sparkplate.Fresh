# üîÑ **Reasoning: Temporary Removal of Tezos Domains and Unstoppable Domains Services**

**Date:** June 2, 2025  
**Decision Type:** Temporary Service Reduction  
**Scope:** Domain Resolution Functionality  
**Impact Level:** Medium - Feature Reduction with Preservation Path

---

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

This document outlines the reasoning behind the temporary removal of Tezos Domains and Unstoppable Domains resolution services from the Sparkplate Fresh application. The decision was driven by critical dependency conflicts that completely blocked development workflows, requiring immediate resolution to maintain project momentum.

### **Key Decision Points**
- **Immediate Problem:** Blocking dependency conflicts preventing npm install
- **Strategic Response:** Temporary service removal with preservation architecture
- **User Impact:** Graceful degradation with clear communication
- **Future Path:** Well-defined reintegration strategy

---

## üö® **Problem Analysis**

### **Technical Root Cause**
The core issue stemmed from incompatible peer dependency requirements in the Tezos ecosystem:

```
@tezos-domains/taquito-client@1.32.0
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requires: @taquito/taquito@20.0.0 (exact)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conflicts with: @taquito/tzip16@20.1.2  
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requires: @taquito/taquito@20.1.2
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ npm ERESOLVE unable to resolve
```

### **Ecosystem Challenges**
1. **Rapid Version Changes:** Tezos packages frequently update with breaking changes
2. **Strict Peer Dependencies:** Exact version requirements prevent flexible resolution
3. **Transitive Conflicts:** Dependencies of dependencies creating complex conflict webs
4. **Immature Ecosystem:** Packages not following semantic versioning best practices

### **Business Impact Without Resolution**
- **Development Blocked:** Unable to install dependencies for any development work
- **CI/CD Failure:** Build pipelines would fail at dependency installation
- **Team Productivity:** Complete halt of feature development and bug fixes
- **Deployment Impossible:** Unable to create production builds

**Cons:**
- Unstable dependency resolution
- Potential runtime errors from version mismatches  
- npm warnings and security vulnerabilities
- Unpredictable behavior in production

**Verdict:** ‚ùå Rejected - Too risky for production application

#### **Option 2: Manual Dependency Management**
**Pros:**
- Might resolve specific conflicts
- Keeps desired functionality

**Cons:**
- Time-intensive investigation process
- No guarantee of success with current package versions
- Blocks development for uncertain duration
- May require maintaining forks

**Verdict:** ‚ùå Rejected - Uncertain timeline, blocks critical work

#### **Option 3: Temporary Service Removal (Selected)**

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ Selected - Best balance of immediate needs and future flexibility

### **Risk Assessment**

#### **Low Risk Factors**
- ENS functionality preserved (primary use case)
- User interface clearly communicates limitations
- Code architecture maintained for easy restoration
- No breaking changes to existing users of ENS

#### **Medium Risk Factors**
- Some users may depend on Tezos domain resolution

## üèóÔ∏è **Implementation Strategy**

### **Service Preservation Architecture**
The implementation was designed to minimize disruption and maximize restoration potential:

```typescript
// Preservation Pattern: Comment out imports, preserve logic
// import Resolution from '@unstoppabledomains/resolution'; // Commented for restoration

export async function getAddress(params): Promise<string> {
  // Temporary stub with clear error messaging
  throw new Error('Unstoppable Domains resolution temporarily unavailable');
  
  /* PRESERVED IMPLEMENTATION - Uncomment for restoration
  const address = await resolution.addr(domain, coinTicker.toUpperCase());
  if (!address) {
    throw new Error(`No ${coinTicker.toUpperCase()} address found for ${domain}`);
  }
  return address;
  */
}
```

### **User Experience Strategy**
1. **Transparent Communication:** Clear notices about temporary unavailability
2. **Visual Indicators:** Grayed out unavailable options with explanatory text
3. **Graceful Errors:** Helpful error messages instead of crashes
4. **Functionality Preservation:** Keep working services fully functional

### **Code Quality Maintenance**
- **Documentation:** Every change thoroughly documented
- **Comment Preservation:** Original implementation preserved in comments
- **Interface Consistency:** Service interfaces maintained for seamless restoration
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error messages for debugging

---

## üîÑ **Reintegration Strategy**

### **Monitoring Approach**
Regular monitoring of the Tezos and Unstoppable Domains ecosystems:

1. **Package Version Tracking:**
   - Monitor npm releases for `@taquito/*` packages
   - Track `@tezos-domains/*` package updates
   - Watch for `@unstoppabledomains/resolution` compatibility improvements

2. **Community Engagement:**
   - Follow Tezos Domains GitHub repositories
   - Monitor Unstoppable Domains developer communications
   - Participate in community discussions about dependency management

3. **Dependency Analysis:**
   - Weekly checks of package compatibility
   - Automated dependency update testing
   - Version compatibility matrix maintenance

### **Restoration Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Dependency Resolution (Immediate)**
- **Trigger:** Compatible package versions available
- **Action:** Add packages back to `package.json` individually
- **Testing:** Verify npm install succeeds without conflicts
- **Rollback:** Remove packages if conflicts persist

#### **Phase 2: Code Restoration (Same Sprint)**
- **Trigger:** Successful dependency installation
- **Action:** Uncomment preserved implementation code
- **Testing:** Unit tests for domain resolution functions
- **Validation:** Manual testing of domain resolution

#### **Phase 3: UI Enablement (Next Sprint)**
- **Trigger:** Backend services working correctly
- **Action:** Re-enable UI options and remove warning notices
- **Testing:** End-to-end user interface testing
- **Documentation:** Update user documentation

#### **Phase 4: Full Feature Restoration (Following Sprint)**
- **Trigger:** All services working in development
- **Action:** Production deployment with full feature set
- **Monitoring:** User analytics for feature usage
- **Support:** Enhanced error handling and user support

### **Alternative Implementation Paths**

#### **Direct API Integration**
If SDK packages continue to have dependency issues:
- **Tezos Domains:** Direct GraphQL API integration
- **Unstoppable Domains:** Direct REST API calls
- **Benefits:** No SDK dependency conflicts, more control
- **Tradeoffs:** More implementation work, less community support

#### **Microservice Architecture**
For complex dependency management:
- **Service Isolation:** Separate services for each domain provider
- **API Gateway:** Central service coordination
- **Benefits:** Dependency isolation, independent scaling
- **Tradeoffs:** Increased infrastructure complexity

#### **Progressive Loading**
For improved user experience:
- **Dynamic Imports:** Load domain services on demand
- **Feature Detection:** Enable features as services become available
- **Benefits:** Faster initial load, graceful degradation
- **Tradeoffs:** More complex state management
