# Progress — Internationalization System & Spanish Translations

Date: 08/08/2025

Scope: Implemented a comprehensive localization (i18n) system with proper directory structure, translation utilities, and Spanish translations for WindowsLogin and SignupModal components.

## Key changes

1) New localization system
- Created `src/locales/` directory with JSON files for each supported language
- Added `src/locales/index.ts` with typed utility functions for translation management
- Created `src/lib/i18n.ts` for consistent access to translations across components
- Improved language names to use native forms ("Español" instead of "Spanish")

2) Supported languages
- English (en)
- Spanish (es)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Portuguese (pt)

3) Components refactored for i18n
- WindowsLogin: All UI text now uses the translation system
- SignupModal: Fully internationalized with Spanish translations
- LanguageSelector: Refactored to use the new locales structure

4) TypeScript enhancements
- Added `LocaleCode` type for type-safe language selection
- Added `Translations` type for type-safe translation key access
- Implemented proper fallback to English when translations are missing

5) Translation coverage
- Login screen: Welcome message, user selection prompt, password field, buttons
- SignupModal: All form labels, placeholders, headings, and button text
- "Create Account" text in user selection now translates properly
- Error/instruction messages properly translated

## Files changed

- New files:
  - `src/locales/en.json`: English translations
  - `src/locales/es.json`: Spanish translations
  - `src/locales/fr.json`: French translations
  - `src/locales/de.json`: German translations
  - `src/locales/pt.json`: Portuguese translations
  - `src/locales/index.ts`: Translation utility functions and types
  - `src/lib/i18n.ts`: Language configuration and re-exports

- Modified:
  - `src/components/LanguageSelector.tsx`: Removed inline translations, refactored for i18n system
  - `src/components/WindowsLogin.tsx`: Updated to use translation system, pass language to modals
  - `src/components/SignupModal.tsx`: Added language prop, replaced hardcoded text with translations

## Translation features

- User-specific content like "Create Account" now dynamically translates
- Form field labels and placeholders now properly localized
- All button text properly translates
- Input placeholders ("Password" → "Contraseña") now correctly translated
- Improved language names in selector (native names like "Español" instead of "Spanish")

## Build/tests
- Linting: All files pass linting checks
- Build: Production build successful

## Next steps
- Implement translations for TemporaryKeyModal and NetworkOptions components
- Add missing translations for other languages (currently focused on Spanish)
- Consider implementing RTL (right-to-left) language support for appropriate languages
- Add language persistence via localStorage or cookies
