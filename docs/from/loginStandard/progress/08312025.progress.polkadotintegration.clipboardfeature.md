# Progress — Polkadot integration and clipboard functionality

Date: 08/31/2025

Scope: Added Polkadot (DOT) support to the TemporaryKeyModal with proper ed25519 key derivation and implemented clipboard functionality for wallet addresses and public keys.

## Key changes

1) Polkadot (DOT) integration
- Added DOT to the `SupportedTicker` type in TemporaryKeyModal
- Added DOT to the `NETWORKS` array with appropriate icon and label
- Implemented proper DOT wallet derivation using the Polkadot cryptography libraries
- Fixed address derivation to correctly generate addresses from ed25519 private keys

2) Cryptography implementation
- Added support for Polkadot's ed25519 key derivation
- Implemented proper SS58 address encoding with Polkadot's prefix (0)
- Fixed the derivation process to generate the correct address for a given private key
- Updated block explorer link to use Polkadot's Subscan explorer

3) Dependency management
- Added required Polkadot dependencies:
  - @polkadot/util
  - @polkadot/util-crypto
  - @polkadot/keyring
- Configured proper cryptographic functions for ed25519 key handling

4) Clipboard functionality
- Added copy buttons next to wallet address and public key
- Implemented clipboard API integration with proper error handling
- Added visual feedback with toast notifications on successful copy
- Improved UI with hover effects and tooltips for copy buttons

5) User experience improvements
- Enhanced the display of wallet addresses and public keys
- Added clear visual separation between address and copy button
- Implemented toast notifications for user feedback
- Maintained responsive design for different screen sizes

## Files touched
- `src/components/currencies/DOT.Polkadot.ts` (enhanced)
- `src/components/accessControl/authentication/loginStandard/options/TemporaryKeyModal.tsx` (enhanced)
- `package.json` (dependencies added)

## Technical details
- Used Polkadot's `ed25519PairFromSeed` for proper key derivation
- Implemented `encodeAddress` with SS58 prefix 0 for Polkadot mainnet
- Added clipboard API with proper promise handling
- Integrated Lucide React's Copy icon for better UI
- Used Sonner toast for non-intrusive notifications

## Build/tests
- Lint clean; production build succeeds
- Verified correct address generation for the provided ed25519 private key
- Confirmed address `13Drq6mGkdnowAYGuGedryDP7x48i18sSGctrjVafSGNND1Q` is correctly derived
- Tested clipboard functionality across different browsers

## Follow-ups
- Add support for sr25519 keys in addition to ed25519
- Implement balance fetching for Polkadot accounts
- Add transaction signing capabilities for Polkadot
- Consider adding more Polkadot ecosystem tokens (KSM, GLMR, etc.)
