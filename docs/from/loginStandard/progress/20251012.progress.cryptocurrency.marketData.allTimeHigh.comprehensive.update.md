## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Conflicting Data Sources
**Problem:** Initial web searches returned conflicting ATH data from different sources, with some showing historical 2021 data instead of current 2025 ATHs.

**Solution:** 
- Conducted multiple targeted searches for current 2025 market data
- Identified Coinbird as the most reliable and current source
- Cross-referenced major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, BNB) to verify data accuracy

### Challenge 2: Date Format Inconsistency
**Problem:** Original files had mixed date formats (some "May 10, 2021", some "2021-05-10").

**Solution:**
- Standardized all dates to ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Ensures consistency across all cryptocurrency files
- Makes dates machine-readable and sortable

### Challenge 3: Minor Price Variations
**Problem:** Small discrepancies in ATH prices between different data providers (e.g., $0.7376 vs $0.73 for DOGE).

**Solution:**
- Used Coinbird as the authoritative source
- Rounded to reasonable precision where appropriate
- Maintained accuracy while avoiding false precision
