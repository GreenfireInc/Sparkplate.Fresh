# Keybindings - CommandField Implementation
**Date:** September 21, 2025
**Author:** System Assistant
**Task:** Implement a command field modal triggered by keyboard shortcut

## Overview
Created a keyboard shortcut system (Ctrl+Shift+~) to trigger a command input modal positioned in the upper left corner of the application. This provides users with a convenient way to execute commands directly from any screen without navigating through menus.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created Directory Structure
- Added `keybindings` folder within the global components directory
- Set up proper file structure and exports

### 2. Command Field Component
- Implemented `CommandField.tsx` with the following features:
  - Modal dialog with text input field
  - Positioned in the upper left corner (top-16 left-4)
  - Keyboard shortcut activation (Ctrl+Shift+~)
  - ESC key to close
  - Enter key to submit commands
  - Command callback function for processing input

### 3. Event Handling
- Added keyboard event listeners for activation
- Created clean-up logic to prevent memory leaks
- Implemented command submission handling

### 4. Styling
- Used existing UI component library
- Styled with Tailwind CSS classes
- Added Terminal icon for visual cue
- Ensured consistent design with application theme

### 5. Integration
- Imported and placed in LoginStandard component
- Added proper command handling callback
- Ensured it appears above other UI elements with appropriate z-index

## UI/UX Considerations
- Modal positioned for visibility without obstructing main UI
- Keyboard shortcut follows industry standards for command palettes
- Simple, focused interface for quick command entry
- Clear visual feedback for user actions

## Next Steps
- Implement command processing logic
- Add command history functionality
- Consider adding command suggestions or auto-complete
- Add support for custom command shortcuts

## Technical Implementation
Used React hooks and event listeners to capture keyboard shortcuts, combined with Radix UI Dialog and Command primitives for the modal interface. The component was designed to be reusable throughout the application with a simple callback pattern for command processing.

## Testing Notes
- Verified keyboard shortcut works as expected
- Confirmed modal positioning and styling
- Tested command submission flow
- Checked proper event cleanup on component unmount
