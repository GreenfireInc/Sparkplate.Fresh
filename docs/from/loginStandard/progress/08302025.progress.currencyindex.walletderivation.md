# Progress — Currency index implementation and wallet derivation improvements

Date: 08/30/2025

Scope: Created a comprehensive cryptocurrency index in a modular structure, enhanced the TemporaryKeyModal with proper wallet derivation for all supported currencies, and improved the UI with blockchain explorer integration.

Key changes

1) New currency index structure
- Created `src/components/currencies/` directory with modular structure
- Implemented `currencyData.ts` with TypeScript interfaces for currency information
- Added individual currency files for ALGO, BNB, DOGE, ETH, LTC, DOT, SOL, LUNC, and XTZ
- Created main `index.ts` export file with lookup objects and utilities

2) Currency data standardization
- Implemented consistent data structure across all currencies
- Added comprehensive metadata: name, ticker, description, creator, debut year
- Included technical information: proofing type, class, total supply
- Added market data: all-time high price and date
- Integrated social media links: Discord, LinkedIn, Reddit, Telegram, Twitter/X
- Added blockchain identifiers: UCID, BraveNewCoin, CoinAPI, CoinCap, CoinGecko, CoinPaprika
- Included block explorer links for all currencies

3) TemporaryKeyModal enhancements
- Integrated currency data from the new currency index
- Fixed wallet derivation for all supported currencies
- Added proper Tezos (XTZ) support with ed25519 key derivation
- Implemented Dogecoin (DOGE) address derivation
- Enhanced BNB support using the same mechanism as Ethereum

4) UI improvements
- Added blockchain explorer links for generated wallet addresses
- Implemented formatted address display with ticker prefix: `%ticker%://%address%`
- Added public key display below the wallet address
- Centered currency logo on QR code for better visual identification
- Commented out transaction-related UI elements to focus on address generation

5) Error handling and debugging
- Added comprehensive error handling for private key validation
- Implemented detailed error messages for debugging
- Added support for multiple private key formats (hex, WIF, edsk)
- Fixed Tezos private key handling for edsk format

6) Technical improvements
- Configured ed25519 library with proper SHA-512 implementation
- Enhanced regex validation for private key inputs
- Improved address generation algorithms for all currencies
- Added reset functionality when changing currency selection
