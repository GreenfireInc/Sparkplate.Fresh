I did a deeper scan. Below is a more detailed breakdown of which of your listed crypto / pricing data providers are known to offer free or freemium API access, what I found (endpoints, docs, usage limits), and some additional ones you’re likely missing.

✅ From your list: which ones have free / freemium API access (or “get started for free”)
Here’s what I found for each, with links:
Provider Free / Freemium Access? Notes, Endpoints & Documentation Links Blockmarkets Yes They claim a free cryptocurrency API with unlimited monthly requests, including real-time and historical data. (Traders Magazine) I did not find a fully detailed public API docs page in the scan, but the offer is described in press / announcements. Coindar Yes (for event data) Coindar has an API 2.0 for crypto event / calendar data. You need to register to get an access token. (Coindar — Cryptocurrency Calendar) Example: https://coindar.org/api/v2/coins?access_token={token} (Coindar — Cryptocurrency Calendar) They also provide a widget API for events: https://coindar.org/api/widget_events?... (Coindar — Cryptocurrency Calendar) CoinAPI Freemium / start free Their site offers unified real-time & historical crypto data APIs. (CoinAPI) Documentation: https://docs.coinapi.io/ (docs.coinapi.io) CoinCap Yes (freemium / “PRO” model) They provide real-time pricing, market data APIs. (pro.coincap.io) Docs: https://pro.coincap.io/api-docs/ (pro.coincap.io) Their “Quickstart” page: https://coincapapi.mintlify.app/quickstart (coincapapi.mintlify.app) CoinGecko Yes (free tier) They have generous free API access (rate limited) for live & historical data. (CoinGecko API) Docs: https://docs.coingecko.com/ (CoinGecko API) Coinigy Likely (for account / exchange integration) They provide an API for interacting with your Coinigy account and tied exchanges. (Coinigy) Docs: https://www.coinigy.com/en/platform/api/ and https://coinigy.docs.apiary.io/ (coinigy.docs.apiary.io) Coinlayer Yes (free plan) Their site states “Get a free API access key” to start using their API. (coinlayer.com) Pricing page: free plan allows 100 requests/month. (coinlayer.com) Docs: https://coinlayer.com/documentation (coinlayer.com) CoinMarketCap Yes (free / “Starter” tier) They allow developers to “Get started for free” in their API offering. (CoinMarketCap) Their API documentation is accessible via their site. (CoinMarketCap) CryptoCompare Yes (free / basic tier) Their API is widely known and used with a free/basic plan. (Bitcoin Stack Exchange) Their API is called “min-api” in many usages (https://min-api.cryptocompare.com) (Bitcoin Stack Exchange) 
For the others in your list — BitDataset, BraveNewCoin, CoinCap, CoinLib, CoinPaprika, Coinograph, Coinscious, Cryptonator, DataLight, Delta, Kaiko, Nomics, Zloadr — I either found no clear free-tier API advertised in the scan, or evidence was insufficient / ambiguous. (They may offer private or paid APIs, or limited trial access.)

🔍 Additional crypto pricing / market data APIs I discovered
While scanning, I also found several other providers / APIs that are good candidates (some free or freemium) not in your original list:
    • CoinLore — a public, free crypto API with no registration required. Covers many coins & exchanges.
        ◦ Docs / site: https://www.coinlore.com/cryptocurrency-data-api (CoinLore)
    • DIA (Decentralised Information Asset) — offers free crypto market data via GraphQL / REST. (Mentioned via “Power your application with free crypto API” by DIADATA) (DIA)
    • Amberdata — institutional-grade market + blockchain data; may have free or trial tiers. (Amberdata)
    • Crypto APIs (CryptoAPIs.io) — infrastructure + market data suite. They may have free/low-tier plans. (Crypto APIs)
    • FinancialDatasets.ai — offers “Crypto Prices API” (historical + real-time) with tiered access. (Financial Datasets)

📋 Summary Table (with known free / freemium ones & docs)
Here’s a polished summary:
Provider Free / Freemium? API / Endpoint / Base URL Documentation / API docs link Blockmarkets Yes (free) RESTful / normalized pricing, unlimited requests (as claimed) (Traders Magazine) (No clear public docs found in scan) Coindar Yes (for events) https://coindar.org/api/v2/…?access_token={token} (Coindar — Cryptocurrency Calendar) Coindar API docs: “Cryptocurrency Calendar API 2.0 Documentation” (Coindar — Cryptocurrency Calendar) CoinAPI Yes (freemium) Market / historical unified API (base paths via their docs) (CoinAPI) https://docs.coinapi.io/ (docs.coinapi.io) CoinCap Yes (freemium / “PRO”) https://api.coincap.io/v2/... etc. (pro.coincap.io) CoinCap API docs: https://pro.coincap.io/api-docs/ (pro.coincap.io) CoinGecko Yes (free tier) Many endpoints like /simple/price, /coins/markets, etc. (CoinGecko) https://docs.coingecko.com/ (CoinGecko API) Coinigy Likely (account / exchange interface) API to interact with user’s Coinigy account & exchanges (authenticated) (coinigy.docs.apiary.io) Coinigy API docs: https://coinigy.docs.apiary.io/ (coinigy.docs.apiary.io) Coinlayer Yes (free plan) Base: https://api.coinlayer.com/ with access_key parameter (coinlayer.com) Documentation: https://coinlayer.com/documentation (coinlayer.com) CoinMarketCap Yes (starter / free tier) Various endpoints for price, historical, exchange data (CoinMarketCap) API docs accessible via their site (CMC API section) (CoinMarketCap) CryptoCompare Yes (basic / free) min-api.cryptocompare.com etc. (Bitcoin Stack Exchange) CryptoCompare API docs (on their site) (Bitcoin Stack Exchange) 

If you like, I can try to pull up live working free API keys / endpoints for as many of these as possible (for your development), and also check exactly which of the “unknown ones” (BitDataset, BraveNewCoin, etc.) truly do or don’t have free plans. Do you want me to do that next?
