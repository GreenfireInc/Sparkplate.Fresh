Here’s a summary of known IPFS‑based storage / pinning services (from your list + a few more) — along with their publicly available NPM packages (SDK/clients) and main API endpoints (or how you interface with them). Where a service seems deprecated or changed, I point that out.

✅ Services from your list — with packages & endpoints
Service NPM / JS package (or SDK) API / endpoint (or how to use) Filebase Via unified libraries such as ipfs-storage or ipfs-free (see below) (npm) IPFS Pinning Service API: https://api.filebase.io/v1/ipfs/pins (docs.filebase.com) Authenticated via Authorization: Bearer <access-token> (docs.filebase.com) Support for pinning/unpinning, listing pins, etc. (docs.filebase.com) Also recently Filebase offers a hosted IPFS RPC‑compatible API (so you can use /add, /pin/add, /cat etc) — a hosted alternative to running your own IPFS node. (Reddit) Pinata Official SDK has evolved; use pinata-web3 (or now the updated [email protected]) per their migration guide. (docs.pinata.cloud) IPFS Pinning Services API endpoint: https://api.pinata.cloud/psa (docs.pinata.cloud) Requires JWT access token (created in Pinata dashboard) for authentication. (docs.pinata.cloud) Lighthouse (often Lighthouse.storage) Official package: @lighthouse‑web3/sdk (docs.lighthouse.storage) Use Lighthouse API to upload content. Example via SDK: lighthouse.upload(...) after obtaining API key. (docs.lighthouse.storage) For “Filecoin-first” mode (pinning existing CID to Filecoin via Lighthouse), there is an endpoint like https://filecoin-first.lighthouse.storage/api/v1/pin/add_cid?cid=... with Bearer token auth. (docs.lighthouse.storage) Storacha (formerly web3.storage) JS client: @storacha/client (npm.io) (older package: @web3-storage/upload-api, but that is now deprecated) (npm) Use the Storacha JS client (or CLI) to upload files / directories. The service is IPFS‑compatible; contents are retrievable via public IPFS gateways given the CID. (docs.storacha.network) Storacha uses UCAN-based auth, not just bearer tokens. (npm.io) NFT.Storage Official npm package (historically) — but note: their Classic upload & pinning APIs were decommissioned as of 30 June 2024. (GitHub) Their “Pinning Service API” (for re‑pinning existing CIDs) was at https://api.nft.storage/pins (dev.nft.storage) But this is now of limited use, mainly for migrating old data. (NFT.storage) (Implicit) multiprovider abstraction libraries ipfs-free — supports multiple platforms (Pinata, Filebase, Lighthouse, Storacha/web3, Infura, etc.) (npm) ipfs-storage — unified API for Filebase, Storacha, Pinata, Lighthouse (npm) These libraries abstract away provider‑specific SDKs/APIs — great if you want a unified interface across multiple IPFS storage providers. (npm) 

⚠️ Important notes / caveats
    • NFT.Storage is deprecated for new uploads: As of June 30, 2024 — the “Classic” upload/pin API of NFT.Storage is no longer accepting new uploads. Existing data remains accessible, but they encourage migration to other “hot storage” providers like Pinata or Lighthouse. (GitHub)
    • Storacha replaces web3.storage: The older @web3-storage/upload-api is deprecated; the recommended SDK is now @storacha/client. (npm)
    • Pinning API compliance matters: If you want to integrate with the standard IPFS tooling (e.g., ipfs pin remote via CLI or IPFS Desktop), services that implement the standardized IPFS Pinning Services API — such as Pinata and Filebase — are easiest to integrate. (docs.pinata.cloud)
    • Storacha (and similar newer services) may forego “Pinning API spec” support: For example, Storacha does not support the Pinning API spec in the same way as older “pinning service” providers — they tend to expect CAR‑file uploads or their own protocol via UCANs. (IPFS Forums)

🔎 Services you asked about but with limited/no clear public documentation (or possibly not existing)
    • Dcent — I found no credible public documentation indicating that “Dcent” provides an IPFS pinning/storage service (nor NPM packages, nor an official API endpoint). It may be that the name is misspelled, conflated, or refers to a private/self‑hosted solution.
    • “fly” — similarly, I could not find a mainstream IPFS pinning/storage service named “fly” with public NPM SDK/API endpoints. There are many “fly”-prefixed or suffixed services in Web3/hosted infra, but none clearly matching “fly IPFS service.”

🧠 Recommendations / What I suggest doing now (if you’re building something)
    • If you want stable, well-documented, pinning‑service‑compliant storage: use Filebase or Pinata. They support the standard IPFS Pinning Services API and integrate smoothly with IPFS CLI or Desktop.
    • If you want a modern, decentralized/hot storage + Filecoin‑backed storage with more web3‑native auth: consider Storacha — using @storacha/client.
    • If you want a “pay‑once, store permanently / Filecoin‑backed + IPFS + flexibility” model: Lighthouse is a strong candidate.
    • If you want a single unified interface for many providers (especially if you plan to support multiple options): consider using ipfs-storage or ipfs-free — these abstract over provider differences and let you switch providers with minimal code changes.

If you like — I can build a full JSON table of ~ 15–20 IPFS storage / pinning services (public + community ones), with their NPM packages, endpoints, free tier limits (if any), and notes (deprecated / active / special auth).
Do you want me to build that for you now?

If you were thinking of a specific IPFS-related service named "fly," please clarify.DcentNo dedicated NPM package found.No dedicated REST API endpoint found.Dcent appears to be a hardware wallet provider. No relevant, dedicated IPFS pinning service NPM package or public API endpoint was found.QuickNode (Missing from your list)Uses a general HTTP client like axios or fetchhttps://api.quicknode.com/ipfs/restThis is a cloud provider offering a decentralized storage solution with a dedicated IPFS REST API for pinning and gateway services.

🛠️ General IPFS Interaction
Many IPFS services also work with the generic, low-level IPFS clients, especially if they support the standard IPFS Pinning Services API Spec.
    • ipfs-http-client (Deprecated in favor of Helia): This legacy package was used to interact with any IPFS node's HTTP RPC API (default local endpoint: http://localhost:5001/api/v0).
    • @ipfs-shipyard/pinning-service-client: A client specifically designed to interact with any service that conforms to the official IPFS Pinning Services API Specification. This is a powerful, generic way to integrate with services like Pinata, which support this specification.

Perplexity
Here is a list of NPM packages and API endpoints for IPFS services including Dcent, Filebase, fly, Lighthouse, nft.storage, Pinata, storacha, web3.storage, and additional ones found:
    • Dcent
        ◦ Dcent offers an IPFS C++ API client library but does not appear to have a dedicated NPM package.
        ◦ GitHub: DECENTfoundation/cpp-ipfs-api provides API bindings for C++ to interact with IPFS.
    • Filebase
        ◦ NPM integration via libraries like "ipfs-storage" which supports Filebase with credentials (access key, secret, bucket).
        ◦ Requires configuration with API keys for usage.
    • fly
        ◦ No specific details found on NPM or documented API endpoints for fly IPFS integration directly, may require further investigation.
    • Lighthouse
        ◦ Supported by "ipfs-storage" NPM package with API credentials for token-based access.
    • nft.storage
        ◦ npm package: nft.storage enables uploading files to IPFS, but uploads have been deprecated and shifted towards alternatives like Pinata and Lighthouse.
    • Pinata
        ◦ Has a dedicated NPM package @pinata/sdk.
        ◦ Uses JWT token for authentication in API requests.
        ◦ Offers REST API endpoints to pin/unpin files and manage pinned content.
    • Storacha (formerly web3.storage)
        ◦ Supported in the "ipfs-storage" unified package but requires using their CLI tool (w3 login) for authentication.
        ◦ Web3.storage package web3.storage npm is deprecated; Storacha recommended as replacement.
    • web3.storage
        ◦ Was available as NPM package web3.storage but now deprecated with uploads discontinued. Users are advised to switch to Storacha or other services.
    • Additional
        ◦ ipfs-storage is a unified interface NPM package that supports Filebase, Storacha, Pinata, Lighthouse, and some others for file upload and deletion.
        ◦ ipfs-free is another aggregation package supporting uploading to Infura, Pinata, etc., with a consistent API.
        ◦ IPFS Cluster provides REST API endpoints for pinning and managing distributed IPFS nodes, useful for cluster management rather than a single storage service.

Qwen
Below is a comprehensive list of **NPM packages** and **API endpoints** (where applicable) for the IPFS services you mentioned—**Dcent**, **Filebase**, **Fly**, **Lighthouse**, **nft.storage**, **Pinata**, **Storacha**, and **web3.storage**—along with a few notable **additional services** that are commonly used for IPFS pinning or storage.

> **Note**: Some services (like Dcent and Fly) are **not full IPFS storage/pinning providers**, so they may not have dedicated NPM packages or IPFS-specific APIs. I’ve clarified their status.

---

### ✅ **1. nft.storage**
- **Website**: https://nft.storage/
- **NPM Package**:  
  [`nft.storage`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nft.storage)
- **API Endpoint**:  
  `https://api.nft.storage`  
  (Upload: `POST https://api.nft.storage/upload`)
- **Authentication**: API token in header (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`)

---

### ✅ **2. Pinata**
- **Website**: https://www.pinata.cloud/
- **NPM Package**:  
  Official: [`@pinata/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pinata/sdk)  
  Community alternatives exist, but this is Pinata’s official SDK.
- **API Endpoint**:  
  `https://api.pinata.cloud`  
  (Upload file: `POST https://api.pinata.cloud/pinning/pinFileToIPFS`)
- **Authentication**: JWT-style API keys (`pinata_api_key` and `pinata_secret_api_key` in headers)

---

### ✅ **3. web3.storage**
- **Website**: https://web3.storage/
- **NPM Package**:  
  [`web3.storage`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3.storage)
- **API Endpoint**:  
  `https://api.web3.storage`  
  (Upload: `POST https://api.web3.storage/upload`)
- **Authentication**: Bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`)

> ⚠️ **Note**: web3.storage paused new uploads as of **April 2023**, but the API and NPM package remain useful for retrieval and legacy use. Check current status before relying on it for new projects.

---

### ✅ **4. Lighthouse**
- **Website**: https://lighthouse.storage/
- **NPM Package**:  
  [`lighthouse-web3`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lighthouse-web3)
- **API Endpoints**:  
  REST API base: `https://node.lighthouse.storage/api`  
  - Upload: `POST https://node.lighthouse.storage/api/lighthouse/upload`
  - Get CID: `GET https://gateway.lighthouse.storage/ipfs/<cid>`
- **Authentication**: Uses API key (free tier available); also supports encryption via `lighthouse-web3`

---

### ✅ **5. Filebase**
- **Website**: https://filebase.com/
- **Compatibility**: S3-compatible object storage that **supports IPFS pinning via IPFS API gateway**
- **NPM Package**:  
  No official Filebase-specific IPFS NPM package, but can use:
  - [`aws-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk) (v2) or [`@aws-sdk/client-s3`](https) (v3) for S3 operations  
  - For IPFS: Use IPFS HTTP client + Filebase’s IPFS gateway (`ipfs.filebase.io`)
- **IPFS Gateway**:  
  `https://ipfs.filebase.io/ipfs/<cid>`
- **Pin API**: Filebase supports **IPFS pinning via the Pinning Services API** (compatible with `ipfs-http-client`)

> ✅ Filebase is **Pinning Services API compliant**, so you can use it with standard IPFS clients that support remote pinning.

---

### ⚠️ **6. Dcent**
- **Status**: **Not an IPFS storage/pinning provider**  
- **What it is**: Dcent is a **hardware wallet** brand (formerly Daylight). It does **not offer IPFS storage or APIs**.
- **Conclusion**: No NPM package or IPFS API endpoints.

---

### ⚠️ **7. Fly**
- **Website**: https://fly.io/
- **Status**: Fly.io is a **platform for running full-stack apps**, **not an IPFS storage service**.
- However, you **can self-host an IPFS node** on Fly.io (e.g., using `ipfs/go-ipfs`).
- **No official IPFS NPM or API** from Fly for storage/pinning.
- **Community example**: Deploy IPFS node via Docker on Fly → expose gateway or API.

> ❌ No dedicated NPM package or IPFS pinning API.

---

### ✅ **8. Storacha (formerly Storj / Tardigrade)**
- **Clarification**: Storacha is **not IPFS-native**, but **Uplink** (Storj’s SDK) can store files that are hashed like IPFS CIDs.
- However, **Storj does not natively interoperate with IPFS** unless you use a bridge or custom layer.
- **NPM Package**:  
  [`@storj/uplink`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storj/uplink)
- **IPFS Compatibility**: Limited—**not a drop-in IPFS replacement**.
- **Alternative**: Consider **Estuary** or **Filebase** for true IPFS integration.

> ⚠️ **Not a true IPFS service**, but included for completeness.

---

### ➕ **Other Notable IPFS Services (Missing from Your List)**

#### **9. Estuary**
- **Website**: https://estuary.tech/
- **NPM**: No official SDK, but REST API is well-documented.
- **API**: `https://api.estuary.tech`  
  (Upload: `POST /content/add`)
- **Auth**: API key in header (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`)
- **Note**: Operated by Protocol Labs; widely used for NFT/IPFS pinning.

#### **10. Infura IPFS**
- **Website**: https://www.infura.io/product/ipfs
- **NPM**: No official NPM, but compatible with `ipfs-http-client`
- **API**: `https://ipfs.infura.io:5001/api/v0/...`  
  Supports `add`, `pin/add`, etc.
- **Auth**: Project ID + secret via Basic Auth

#### **11. Fleek Storage (via Fleek IPFS)**
- **Website**: https://fleek.co/storage/
- **NPM**: [`@fleekhq/fleek-storage-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fleekhq/fleek-storage-js)
- **Backend**: Built on **Filecoin + IPFS**
- **API**: Uses bucket-based uploads; returns IPFS CID

#### **12. Crust Network / Crust IPFS**
- **Website**: https://crust.network/
- **Gateway**: `https://ipfs-gw.crust.network/ipfs/<cid>`
- **Pinning**: Supports **Pinning Services API**
- **NPM**: No official SDK, but works with standard IPFS clients

---

### 🔧 Recommended Generic Client
For services that support the **IPFS HTTP API** (e.g., Pinata, Infura, Filebase), you can also use:
- **NPM**: [`ipfs-http-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipfs-http-client)  
  → Works with any compliant IPFS node or gateway.

Example:
```ts
import { create } from 'ipfs-http-client'

const ipfs = create({
  url: 'https://ipfs.infura.io:5001/api/v0'
  // or for Pinata: 'https://api.pinata.cloud'
})
```
