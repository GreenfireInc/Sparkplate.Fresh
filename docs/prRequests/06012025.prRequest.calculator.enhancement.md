## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
```typescript
// Before: Vue 2 Options API
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      fromIsFiat: false,
      // ...
    }
  },
  methods: {
    convertCurrency() {
      // ...
    }
  }
}

// After: Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref, reactive, watch } from 'vue'

interface CryptoCurrency {
  id: string
  symbol: string
  name: string
}

const fromIsFiat = ref(false)
const args = reactive({
  from: { id: 'bitcoin', symbol: 'BTC', name: 'Bitcoin' } as Currency,
  // ...
})

async function convertCurrency() {
  // Enhanced error handling and type safety
}
</script>
```

### Styling Enhancements
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Modern blue-to-indigo gradients for visual appeal
- **Enhanced Cards**: Professional styling with shadows, borders, and hover effects
- **Interactive Elements**: Smooth transitions and animations for better user feedback
- **Typography**: Improved font weights, sizes, and spacing for better readability

## Files Modified
- `src/components/cryptocurrency/Calculator.vue` - Complete Vue 3 implementation (530+ lines)
- `docs/progress/06012025.progress.component.calculator.md` - Updated progress documentation

## Testing Status
- âœ… **Vue 3 Migration**: Successfully converted to Composition API with TypeScript
- âœ… **All Conversion Types**: Crypto-to-fiat, fiat-to-crypto, crypto-to-crypto, fiat-to-fiat
- âœ… **API Integration**: CoinGecko and Exchange Rate APIs functioning correctly
- âœ… **TypeScript Compliance**: All type errors resolved and proper type safety implemented
- âœ… **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to all screen sizes without scrolling
- âœ… **Styling Enhancements**: Modern design system with improved visual hierarchy
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management and user feedback

## Performance Impact
- **Improved**: Vue 3 Composition API provides better performance and tree-shaking
- **Enhanced**: TypeScript integration reduces runtime errors and improves development experience
- **Optimized**: Hardware-accelerated animations and efficient reactivity system
- **Maintained**: Same API efficiency with CoinGecko and Exchange Rate services

## Breaking Changes
- **None**: All existing functionality preserved and enhanced
- **Backward Compatible**: Component interface remains the same
- **Enhanced**: Additional TypeScript support for better development experience

## Dependencies
- **Vue 3**: Composition API and reactive system
- **TypeScript**: Type definitions and safety
- **CoinGecko API**: Cryptocurrency price data (existing)
- **Exchange Rate API**: Fiat currency conversion rates (existing)

## Business Value
