# PR: About Modal Layout and Scrolling Fixes

## Description
This PR addresses critical UI layout issues in the About modal component. It fixes content display problems in the Main tab where system information was not appearing at all, and resolves scrolling issues in the Notes tab where users couldn't access all documentation files.

## Problem
- Main tab content was completely invisible due to height calculation issues
- Documentation file list in Notes tab was not scrollable, preventing access to files beyond what was initially visible
- Modal content layout was unstable and inconsistent across tabs

## Solution
- Replaced percentage-based heights with explicit dimensions for reliable content display
- Implemented direct height specification with overflow control for scrollable areas
- Optimized CSS grid and flex properties to ensure proper space distribution
- Applied targeted fixes to each tab component while keeping visual consistency

## Changes Made
- `src/components/global/About.vue`: Optimized modal grid layout and fixed space distribution
- `src/components/about/Main.vue`: Completely restructured with explicit dimensions and improved layout
- `src/components/about/Notes.vue`: Fixed file list scrolling with direct height specification

## Key Code Changes
```css
/* Main.vue - Self-contained layout */
.main-content-wrapper {
  padding: 1rem;
  min-height: 400px;
}

/* Notes.vue - Scrollable file list */
.file-list {
  height: 350px;
  overflow-y: auto;
}
```

## Testing
- Verified Main tab displays all system information correctly
- Confirmed Notes tab file list scrolls and allows access to all documentation files
- Tested tab switching behavior to ensure consistent layout across all tabs
- Checked layout integrity at different window sizes
