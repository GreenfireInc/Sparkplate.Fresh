**Key Innovation:**
- Double-SHA-256 PRNG: `SHA-256(SHA-256(seed || counter || domain))`
- Domain separation for security
- Pre-generation of random buffer for determinism
- Patching of `crypto.getRandomValues` and `Date.now` for deterministic behavior
- Fixed creation date for fingerprint reproducibility

**Patentability:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High)
- Novel algorithm
- Non-obvious implementation
- Practical utility
- No prior art found for this specific approach

**Licensing Potential:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very High)
- Enterprise wallet solutions
- Hardware wallet manufacturers
- Cryptocurrency exchanges
- Security companies

**Estimated Value:** $50,000 - $200,000 (if patented)

**File:** `src/components/modals/DerivationPathDiveModal.tsx`

**Description:**
A deterministic hashing algorithm that converts user-friendly PINs (4-10 characters) into derivation path indices (0-999,999). This enables memorable "account" access without revealing full seed phrases.

**Key Innovation:**
- Simple bit-shift hash (djb2 variant)
- Deterministic mapping (same PIN → same index)
- Range constraint (0-999,999)
- User-friendly interface

**Patentability:** ⭐⭐ (Low-Medium)
- Algorithm is simple variant of existing hash
- Novel application to wallet derivation
- May be considered obvious combination

**Licensing Potential:** ⭐⭐⭐ (Medium)
- Wallet software companies
- User experience improvements

**Estimated Value:** $5,000 - $25,000

#### 4.1.3. Mnemonic Phrase Expansion Methods

**File:** `src/components/modals/AdvancedModal.tsx`

**Description:**
Four methods for expanding 12-word BIP39 phrases to 24-word phrases while maintaining valid checksums:
1. **Duplicate:** Duplicates entropy (no additional security)
2. **Deterministic:** SHA-256 hash of seed (reproducible)
3. **Random:** Adds random entropy (non-reproducible)
4. **Hybrid:** Combines deterministic + random (partially reproducible)

**Key Innovation:**
- Proper entropy combination for valid BIP39 checksums
- Multiple expansion strategies
- Deterministic option for reproducibility

**Patentability:** ⭐⭐⭐ (Medium)
- Novel combination of existing techniques
- Practical utility
- May have prior art in similar contexts

**Licensing Potential:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High)

Six methods for deriving BIP39 mnemonic phrases from private keys:
1. Direct hex conversion (12-word)
2. Direct hex conversion (24-word)
3. SHA-256 hash derived (12-word)
4. SHA-256 hash derived (24-word)
5. Character mapping (12-word)
6. Character mapping (24-word)

**Key Innovation:**
- Multiple deterministic derivation methods

**Key Innovation:**
- Canvas-based visual rendering
- Transparent text overlay using jsPDF
- Precise coordinate mapping
- White text for invisibility (selectable but not visible)

**Patentability:** ⭐⭐ (Low)
- Combination of existing techniques
- May be considered obvious

**Licensing Potential:** ⭐⭐ (Low-Medium)

## Appendix A: Original Request

> "Please scan this codebase and based on the work of 2 developers at a cost of 40$/hr calculate how long it would take them to develop this, how much it would cost, and ultimately how much this codebase is worth, and what about it is proprietary and can be patented and licensed and what could it potentially generate."

**Analysis Completed:** December 30, 2025  
**Methodology:** Comprehensive codebase analysis, feature breakdown, market research, IP assessment, revenue modeling  
**Deliverables:** Development cost estimate, market valuation, IP analysis, licensing potential, revenue projections
