# ==========================
# ENS Domain Resolution (Optional)
# ==========================
# To enable automatic ENS domain resolution when importing private keys,
# you need to provide at least one of these API keys:

# Infura API Key (Get yours at: https://infura.io/)
# VITE_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id_here

# OR

# Alchemy API Key (Get yours at: https://alchemy.com/)
# VITE_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key_here

# ==========================
# Note: Domain resolution is DISABLED by default
# ==========================
# Without an API key:
# - ENS domains will NOT be resolved
# - Wallet import will still work normally
# - No rate limiting issues

# With an API key:
# - ENS domains will be automatically resolved and displayed
# - Better performance and higher rate limits
# - Recommended for production use
